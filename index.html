                Hello, I'm Spencer Grillot <br> a double Accounting and CIS major with an Internal Audit minor at Pitt State University
            </p>   
            <p></p>
            <p>I graduated from Oswego Junior Senior High back in 2019, after having been there since 7 grade. I then attended Labette Community College for a degree in Accounting, but also got one in Business Administration before I left to come to Pittsburg State University. <br> After my first year, I also got another job here at the Walmart Supercenter as a cashier. I eventually added on a CIS major when I placed very high on Comp Science topics at an FBLA competition.</p>
